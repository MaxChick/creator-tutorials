This graph pattern demonstrates how to use a **loop** node to extrude rectangles based on a sine wave. A **loop** node, when paired with an **iterator**, cycles through connected primitives and applies logic to each one. One of the most important things to remember when pairing **loops** and **iterators** is to make sure that their *tag* is the same

This **loop** cycles through the connected rectangles and extrudes each one based on a different value in a sine wave.

There is a bit of math involved in making this graph work, so take your time exploring the output values of each node to understand the logic behind it.
