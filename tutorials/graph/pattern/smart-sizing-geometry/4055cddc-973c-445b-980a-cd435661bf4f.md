In this graph pattern, we look at the **smart size** node, and how you can resize your geometry while retaining its proportions.

**Smart size** allows you to define an *axis* as well as *lock zones* at the geometry minimum and maximum. These *lock zones* Let geometry within the zones be unaffected by the smart size, remaining the same proportion.

Have a look at the first **smart sizes** inputs to see what it’s doing. You’ll see that it is sizing the geometry along the Z axis (blue), while locking the geometry in the bottom 25% and the top 25% of the window frame. The next **smart size** node is doing the same thing, but along the X axis (red).

Adjust the number parameters to see the smart size in action.
