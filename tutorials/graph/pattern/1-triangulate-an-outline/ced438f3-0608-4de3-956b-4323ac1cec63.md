If you have a curve that you want to turn into a shape in the graph, you can do this using the **triangulate 2d path** node.

In this example, we first take a partial **circle**, turn it into a curve using **points** and **points to curve** and then turn it back into a surface using the **triangulate 2d path** node. 

To turn a curve into a surface using this node, the input curve must be planar (two-dimensional). Once you triangulate it, the surface will be projected back to the 0 value of whichever *work plane* you selected.
