**Curve to polyline** can be used for multiple reasons. The first is to convert a “NURBS” curve to a “polyline”, while the second is to simply change the resolution of a “polyline”.

When converting a “NURBS” curve to a polyline, you will also need to define the resolution of the output curve.

You can define the resolution in multiple ways:

* *Number of segments*
* *Segment length*
* *Approx segment length*

Look at each **curve to polyline** output, and try changing the associated parameter to see how the output curve changes.

Hint: It helps if you turn on point rendering in the 3D viewer toolbar.
