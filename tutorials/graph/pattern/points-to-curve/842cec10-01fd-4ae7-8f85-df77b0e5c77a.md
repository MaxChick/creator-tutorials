In this graph, we demonstrate how to create curves from a set of points. **Points to curve** is one of the most useful nodes youâ€™ll find in Creator.

In this example, we can change the start point (vector) of the curve, as well as the *order*. Changing the order defines how many intersection points the curve has.

Explore the output of the **vector switch** node to understand how the starting point is changing.

Have a look through the rest of the graph to understand how the curve is being created.
