If instead of a straight curve, we wanted to use a non-linear curve as our set of vectors and wanted to rotate the geometry along its tangents, we can use a **normals** node to retrieve this data.

Have a go with the different *tangents*, *normals*, and *binormals* outputs of the **normals** node to their effects in the *normals* and *up vectors* inputs of the **copy using vectors** node.
