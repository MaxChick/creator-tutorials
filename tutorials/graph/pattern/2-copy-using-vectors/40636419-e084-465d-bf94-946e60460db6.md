We can also set the direction that the geometry is rotated towards and around by setting the *normals* and *up vectors* inputs of the **copy using vectors** node.

If for example, we were making a train track, we can set the following inputs for sleepers (which it will be by default).
- *normals* 	=	`0,0,1`
- *up vectors*	=	`0,1,0`

Or, for example we were making a fence with the same original box geometry, we can set the following inputs:
- *normals* 	=	`0,1,0`
- *up vectors*	=	`0,0,1`
