1. Zoom in close to the **collect** node to reveal the edit icon.
2. Click the icon, and type in a new name.
3. Press ENTER to confirm the name.

Youâ€™ll notice that you can zoom in and see the original node type just underneath the node name. This is helpful if you name the node something unrelated to its function, as you can still understand what the node is doing in the graph.
