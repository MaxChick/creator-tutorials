To inspect the data outputs of any node, you must first tag the node as the output.

1. Click on the **number** node, to tag it as the output.
2. Expand the output stub (right) and click on the ‘magnifying glass’ icon on the *value* output.
3. The value of [ 0 ] will now be displayed next to the output pill.
4. When an output has changed and the inspection needs updating, press the ‘refresh’ icon to update it.

If the output is a list of values, you will need to click where the values would be displayed in order to open the list. For example, in the **box** node’s points output, click on the text that reads [ <vector list> ].
