To control which geometry the **switch** we will need to provide it with an *index*. Each geometry connection made to a **switch** will be given an index based on the order it was connected. i.e. “Shade Structure Classic.trb” will have an  index [0], and “Shade Structure Modern.trb” will have an index of [1].

To control this index we will use a **choice** node. This will create a dropdown which we can attribute a selection to a particular index.

Create a **choice** node and set the *options* input to [Classic,Modern].
