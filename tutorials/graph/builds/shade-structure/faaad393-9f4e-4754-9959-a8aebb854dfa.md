Connect the “Shade Structure Classic.trb” to the **switch** node.

As a refresher:

1. LMB-click-drag the gradient coming out of the right (output) side of the 
“Shade Structure Classic.trb” node.
2. Release it on top of the **switch** node.

Then do the same, only connecting the “Shade Structure Modern.trb” node to the **switch** node. This order the connections are made is important as will become clear in the next step.
