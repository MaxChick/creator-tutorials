Next we will copy the purlin geometry across the length of the Shade Structure.

To do so, we will first create a **copy** node from the **get primitive** that outputs the purlin.

We will then set the *translate* input to `0, 500, 0`. This will be the spacing between each copy of the purlin (i.e. every 500mm in the Y axis).
