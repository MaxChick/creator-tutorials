The rail profile that has been already imported to Creator will be copied along the same curve we used previously for the sleepers, and loft the profiles together.

But first, we will need to triangulate the profile into a mesh. This is so that we will be able to position the caps of the rail to the lofted geometry.

To triangulate the profile, create a **triangulate 2d path** node from the “Rail profile” **geometry asset** node.
