To bring a little bit of life to the model, let's add some simple colors.

Create a **set color** node from the **loop** node and set the _color_ input to `0.5,0.5,0.5`.

Then create a second **set color** node from the **copy using vectors** node that contains the sleepers and set the _color_ input to `0.6,0.4,0`.
