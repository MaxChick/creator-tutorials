If you inspect the *points* output of one of the **circle** nodes (by pressing the ‘inspect’ icon, then "vector list"), you will notice that for a circle with four segments, there are five points. This is because an additional point is used to fully complete the circle polyline (you’ll notice the first and last points in the list are the exact same vectors).

If we make lines directly from these circles, we will end up with one too many support ‘legs’. So we need to delete one of the duplicate points. In this case we will just delete the first one as it is the easiest to define (it’s at index 0).

To delete this point, we will use a **delete points** node. Create a **delete points** node from both of the **circle** nodes. Then, set and index list of all the indices we want to delete by doing the following:

1. Click on the `integer list` field from the *index list* input.
2. Click on the “Add item” button.
3. A list will be made, where you can enter a value at each list item. By default this value is 0, so we don’t need to do anything else here.
