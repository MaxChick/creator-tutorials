Create a **transform** node from the **delete points** used to create the smaller circle. We will use this to translate the smaller circle polyline to our desired height.

To do so we will need to supply it with a vector value which we can get by creating an **xyz to vector** node from the *value* output of the “Cauldron height” parameter node and connecting it to the z input. Then connect the *vector* output of the **xyz to vector** node to the *translate* input of the **transform** node.
