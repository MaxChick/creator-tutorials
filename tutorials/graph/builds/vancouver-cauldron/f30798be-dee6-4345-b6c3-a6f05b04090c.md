Although the original Olympic Cauldron has four support ‘legs’ (and therefore can be simplified to two squares), we will instead use two circles. This is because we can change the number of segments within a circle, meaning we can parametrically control the number of ‘legs’.

To start off, create two **circle** nodes and set the *type* input to [polyline] for both.
