This is where the fun begins, adding some geometry to our basic form. In this case we will be using the **cylinder** node as it has two vector inputs. The *start* and *end* inputs will define the position and length of our cylinder.

We can create multiple cylinders from the same **cylinder** node, by inputting a list of vectors for the *start* and *end* inputs. Connect the points output of the base circle’s **delete points** node to the *start* input, and connect the *points* output of the smaller circle’s **transform** node to the *end* input.
