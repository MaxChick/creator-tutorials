For the *end point* we will simply add some height to the current “Cauldron height”. To do so we will create an **add vectors** node from the **xyz to vector** node that is connected to the “Cauldron height” parameter (connecting it to the *vector1* input). Set the *vector2* input to `0,0,2000`. Then connect the *result* output to the *end* input of the main cauldron’s **cylinder** node.
