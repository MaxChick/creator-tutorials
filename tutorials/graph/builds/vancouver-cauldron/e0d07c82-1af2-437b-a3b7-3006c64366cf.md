Often when creating geometry from scratch parametrically, itâ€™s best to consider the form of what we are making in its most simplest form. We can abstractify the Vancouver Olympic Cauldron down to just two squares (the blue lines), the top one rotated, with lines connecting them (the red lines).

From this abstraction, we can then begin to add geometry to it using the basic lines as a reference to build our Cauldron (albeit a simplified version for this tutorial).
