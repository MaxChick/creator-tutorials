That’s the finished tutorial!

As an ‘extra for experts’, have a go at attempting to create the central Cauldron that sits in the middle of the supporting ‘leg’ cauldrons, you’ll need the following things:

* **line** node (set to `points to point` *type*)
  * To get the basic form of the legs.
* **split curve** node (set to *split points only* = `true` and *u* = `0.75`).
  * To get a certain height up the lines.
* **points to curve** node (between the split points).
  * Create a polyline at that height.
* **geometry centroid** node (center of the **points to curve** polyline).
* **cylinder** node (*start* at the **geometry centroid**, *end* somewhere above).
