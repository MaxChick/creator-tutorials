Next, we will build up the main central cauldron. To do this we will again use a cylinder node. In order to find the start and end points of the cylinder we will start off by getting a simplified **line** version of the legs.

Create a **line** node and set the *mode* to `point to point`. Connect the *points* output of the base circle’s **delete points** node to the *start point* input, and connect the *points* output of the upper circle’s **transform** node to the *end point* input.
