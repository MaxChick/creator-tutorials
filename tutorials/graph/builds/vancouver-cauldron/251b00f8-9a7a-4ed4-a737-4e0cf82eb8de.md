For the smaller circle, as it has a smaller radius, we will divide the value of the “Base radius” so as to maintain a consistent scale between them.

To do so, create a **divide** node from the *value* output of the “Base radius” parameter node and connect it to the *value1* input of the newly made **divide** node. Set the *value2* input to `3` (the smaller circle will be ⅓ of the radius of the base circle).

Then, connect the *result* of the **divide** node to the *radius* input of the smaller **circle**.
