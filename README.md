# Tutorial Guidelines

## Text formatting (guidelines):

**bold** = node names/types

*italic* = xput names

ALL CAPS = keyboard actions

CAPS-nocaps = mouse actions

[square brackets] = values to type/action

"Quotes" = names of things (e.g. a renamed node, things from the glossary)

'Apostrophes' = 'vague' descriptions (e.g. 'glow')

## Glossary:

**Graph viewer** = The section of the app that displays the graph + nodes.

**3D viewer** = The section of the app that displays the 3D representation of the current ‘output selected’ node (if it has a computed representation).

**NURBS** = Non-uniform rational B-spline (all caps!)
