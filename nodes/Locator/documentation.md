Creates a locator.

A locator is a point with orientation and can be used in the following cases: An indicator of an important location, as snapping points between objects, as grips/handles to move geometry etc.

Note(s):



* In regards to creating snaps, orientation is important. Two snapping locators will orient themselves to meet their positive x-axes (i.e. positive X to positive X). Their rotation around the x-axes is defined by the z-axes (i.e. so that the two z-axes are aligned and pointed in the same direction).
